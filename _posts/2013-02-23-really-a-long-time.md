# thinking life

really a long time, confused, about the life, dream, reality and the future. which way to go, which life I need, this is really a question. 

you can't get all for perfect, that's just some in tales.  there are always some choices you have to make, each means a totally different way, and some unpredictable results. even though you have selected one, you have to live hard for it. 

there is something you can remind you again and again, but also something you have to bury deep in heart. you have to do something not only for yourself, but also for some people you love, you are not living alone.

anyway you want to change something, just do it. 
hold your dream, step out. 

it's a long way, you are just at one cross.
